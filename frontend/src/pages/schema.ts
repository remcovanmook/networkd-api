The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface.The \"routing-only\" domain \"~.\" (the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This setting is useful to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available.This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service(8). \"Search domains\" correspond to the domain and search entries in resolv.conf(5). Domain name routing has no equivalent in the traditional glibc API, which has no concept of domain name servers limited to a specific link.Added in version 216.",

The label, with suitable LSM rules, can be used to control connectivity of (for example) a service with peers in the local network. At least with SELinux, only the ingress can be controlled but not egress. The benefit of using this setting is that it may be possible to apply interface independent part of NetLabel configuration at very early stage of system boot sequence, at the time when the network interfaces are not available yet, with netlabelctl(8), and the per-interface configuration with systemd-networkd once the interfaces appear later. Currently this feature is only implemented for SELinux.The option expects a single NetLabel label. The label must conform to lexical restrictions of LSM labels. When an interface is configured with IP addresses, the addresses and subnetwork masks will be appended to the NetLabel Fallback Peer Labeling rules. They will be removed when the interface is deconfigured. Failures to manage the labels will be ignored.WarningOnce labeling is enabled for network traffic, a lot of LSM access control points in Linux networking stack go from dormant to active. Care should be taken to avoid getting into a situation where for example remote connectivity is broken, when the security policy has not been updated to consider LSM per-packet access controls and no rules would allow any network traffic. Also note that additional configuration with netlabelctl(8) is needed.Example: [Address] NetLabel=system_u:object_r:localnet_peer_t:s0 With the example rules applying for interface \"eth0\", when the interface is configured with an IPv4 address of 10.0.0.123/8, systemd-networkd performs the equivalent of netlabelctl operation netlabelctl unlbl add interface eth0 address:10.0.0.0/8 label:system_u:object_r:localnet_peer_t:s0 and the reverse operation when the IPv4 address is deconfigured. The configuration can be used with LSM rules; in case of SELinux to allow a SELinux domain to receive data from objects of SELinux \"peer\" class. For example: type localnet_peer_t; allow my_server_t localnet_peer_t:peer recv; The effect of the above configuration and rules (in absence of other rules as may be the case) is to only allow \"my_server_t\" (and nothing else) to receive data from local subnet 10.0.0.0/8 of interface \"eth0\".

Firewall rules using IP address of an interface are also instantly updated when the network configuration changes, for example via DHCP.This option expects a whitespace separated list of NFT set definitions.

The following values are supported:eui64¶ The EUI-64 algorithm will be used to generate an address for that prefix. Only supported by Ethernet or InfiniBand interfaces. Added in version 250.static:ADDRESS¶ An IPv6 address must be specified after a colon (\":\"), and the lower bits of the supplied address are combined with the upper bits of a prefix received in a Router Advertisement (RA) message to form a complete address. Note that if multiple prefixes are received in an RA message, or in multiple RA messages, addresses will be formed from each of them using the supplied address. This mode implements SLAAC but uses a static interface identifier instead of an identifier generated by using the EUI-64 algorithm. Because the interface identifier is static, if Duplicate Address Detection detects that the computed address is a duplicate (in use by another node on the link), then this mode will fail to provide an address for that prefix. If an IPv6 address without mode is specified, then \"static\" mode is assumed. Added in version 250.prefixstable[:ADDRESS][,UUID]¶ The algorithm specified in RFC 7217 will be used to generate interface identifiers. This mode can optionally take an IPv6 address separated with a colon (\":\"). If an IPv6 address is specified, then an interface identifier is generated only when a prefix received in an RA message matches the supplied address. This mode can also optionally take a non-null UUID in the format which sd_id128_from_string() accepts, e.g. \"86b123b969ba4b7eb8b3d8605123525a\" or \"86b123b9-69ba-4b7e-b8b3-d8605123525a\". If a UUID is specified, the value is used as the secret key to generate interface identifiers. If not specified, then an application specific ID generated with the system's machine-ID will be used as the secret key. See sd-id128(3), sd_id128_from_string(3), and sd_id128_get_machine(3). Note that the \"prefixstable\" algorithm uses both the interface name and MAC address as input to the hash to compute the interface identifier, so if either of those are changed the resulting interface identifier (and address) will be changed, even if the prefix received in the RA message has not been changed. Added in version 250.If no address generation mode is specified (which is the default), or a received prefix does not match any of the addresses provided in \"prefixstable\" mode, then the EUI-64 algorithm will be used for Ethernet or InfiniBand interfaces, otherwise \"prefixstable\" will be used to form an interface identifier for that prefix.This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned, then the all previous assignments are cleared.Examples: Token=eui64 Token=::1a:2b:3c:4d Token=static:::1a:2b:3c:4d Token=prefixstable Token=prefixstable:2002:da8:1::Added in version 250.UseDNS=¶When true (the default), the DNS servers received in the Router Advertisement will be used.This corresponds to the nameserver option in resolv.conf(5).Added in version 231.UseDNR=¶ When true, the DNR servers received in the Router Advertisement will be used. Defaults to the value of UseDNS=.Added in version 257.UseDomains=¶Takes a boolean, or the special value \"route\". When true, the domain name received via IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) will be used as DNS search domain over this link, similarly to the effect of the Domains= setting. If set to \"route\", the domain name received via IPv6 RA will be used for routing DNS queries only, but not for searching, similarly to the effect of the Domains= setting when the argument is prefixed with \"~\". Defaults to false.It is recommended to enable this option only on trusted networks, as setting this affects resolution of all hostnames, in particular of single-label names. It is generally safer to use the supplied domain only as routing domain, rather than as search domain, in order to not have it affect local resolution of single-label names.When set to true, this setting corresponds to the domain option in resolv.conf(5).Added in version 231.RouteTable=num¶The table identifier for the routes received in the Router Advertisement. Takes one of predefined names \"default\", \"main\", and \"local\", and names defined in RouteTable= in networkd.conf(5), or a number between 1…4294967295.When used in combination with VRF=, the VRF's routing table is used when this parameter is not specified.Added in version 232.RouteMetric=¶Set the routing metric for the routes received in the Router Advertisement. Takes an unsigned integer in the range 0…4294967295, or three unsigned integer separated with \":\", in that case the first one is used when the router preference is high, the second is for medium preference, and the last is for low preference (\"high:medium:low\"). Defaults to \"512:1024:2048\".Added in version 249.QuickAck=¶Takes a boolean. When true, the TCP quick ACK mode is enabled for the routes configured by the received RAs. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.Added in version 253.UseMTU=¶Takes a boolean. When true, the MTU received in the Router Advertisement will be used.

When true, the reachable time received in the Router Advertisement will be set on the interface receiving the advertisement. It is used as the base timespan of the validity of a neighbor entry. Defaults to true.Added in version 256.UseRetransmissionTime=¶Takes a boolean. When true, the retransmission time received in the Router Advertisement will be set on the interface receiving the advertisement. It is used as the time between retransmissions of Neighbor Solicitation messages to a neighbor when resolving the address or when probing the reachability of a neighbor. Defaults to true.Added in version 256.UseGateway=¶When true (the default), the router address will be configured as the default gateway. Added in version 250.UseRoutePrefix=¶When true (the default), the routes corresponding to the route prefixes received in the Router Advertisement will be configured.Added in version 250.UseCaptivePortal=¶When true (the default), the captive portal received in the Router Advertisement will be recorded and made available to client programs and displayed in the networkctl(1) status output per-link.Added in version 254.UsePREF64=¶When true, the IPv6 PREF64 (or NAT64) prefixes received in the Router Advertisement will be recorded and made available to client programs and displayed in the networkctl(1) status output per-link. See RFC 8781. Defaults to false.Added in version 255.UseAutonomousPrefix=¶When true (the default), the autonomous prefix received in the Router Advertisement will be used and take precedence over any statically configured ones.Added in version 242.UseOnLinkPrefix=¶When true (the default), the onlink prefix received in the Router Advertisement will be used and takes precedence over any statically configured ones.Added in version 242.RouterDenyList=¶A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 router addresses.

Any information advertised by the listed router is ignored.Added in version 248.RouterAllowList=¶A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 router addresses. Each address can optionally take a prefix length after \"/\". Only information advertised by the listed router is accepted. Note that if RouterAllowList= is configured then RouterDenyList= is ignored.Added in version 248.PrefixDenyList=¶A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 prefixes. Each prefix can optionally take its prefix length after \"/\". IPv6 prefixes supplied via router advertisements in the list are ignored.Added in version 248.PrefixAllowList=¶A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 prefixes. Each prefix can optionally take its prefix length after \"/\". IPv6 prefixes supplied via router advertisements in the list are allowed. Note that if PrefixAllowList= is configured then PrefixDenyList= is ignored.Added in version 248.RouteDenyList=¶A whitespace-separated list of IPv6 route prefixes.

Note that if RouteAllowList= is configured then RouteDenyList= is ignored.Added in version 248.DHCPv6Client=¶Takes a boolean, or the special value \"always\". When true, the DHCPv6 client will be started in \"solicit\" mode if the RA has the \"managed\" flag or \"information-request\" mode if the RA lacks the \"managed\" flag but has the \"other configuration\" flag. If set to \"always\", the DHCPv6 client will be started in \"solicit\" mode when an RA is received, even if neither the \"managed\" nor the \"other configuration\" flag is set in the RA. This will be ignored when WithoutRA= in the [DHCPv6] section is enabled, or UplinkInterface=:self in the [DHCPPrefixDelegation] section is specified. Defaults to true.Added in version 246.NetLabel=¶This applies the NetLabel for the addresses received with RA, like NetLabel= in [Address] section applies it to statically configured addresses.

    description: "The [DHCPServer] section contains settings for the DHCP server, if enabled via the DHCPServer= option described above: ServerAddress=¶Specifies the server address for the DHCP server. Takes an IPv4 address with prefix length separated with a slash, e.g. \"192.168.0.1/24\". Defaults to unset, and one of static IPv4 addresses configured in [Network] or [Address] section will be automatically selected. This setting may be useful when the interface on which the DHCP server is running has multiple static IPv4 addresses.This implies Address= in [Network] or [Address] section with the same address and prefix length. That is, [Network] DHCPServer=yes Address=192.168.0.1/24 Address=192.168.0.2/24 [DHCPServer] ServerAddress=192.168.0.1/24 or [Network] DHCPServer=yes [Address] Address=192.168.0.1/24 [Address] Address=192.168.0.2/24 [DHCPServer] ServerAddress=192.168.0.1/24 are equivalent to the following: [Network] DHCPServer=yes Address=192.168.0.2/24 [DHCPServer] ServerAddress=192.168.0.1/24 Since version 255, like the Address= setting in [Network] or [Address] section, this also supports a null address, e.g. \"0.0.0.0/24\", and an unused address will be automatically selected. For more details about the automatic address selection, see Address= setting in [Network] section in the above.Added in version 249.PoolOffset=, PoolSize=¶Configures the pool of addresses to hand out. The pool is a contiguous sequence of IP addresses in the subnet configured for the server address, which does not include the subnet nor the broadcast address. PoolOffset= takes the offset of the pool from the start of subnet, or zero to use the default value. PoolSize= takes the number of IP addresses in the pool or zero to use the default value. By default, the pool starts at the first address after the subnet address and takes up the rest of the subnet, excluding the broadcast address. If the pool includes the server address (the default), this is reserved and not handed out to clients.Added in version 226.DefaultLeaseTimeSec=, MaxLeaseTimeSec=¶Control the default and maximum DHCP lease time to pass to clients. These settings take time values in seconds or another common time unit, depending on the suffix. The default lease time is used for clients that did not ask for a specific lease time. If a client asks for a lease time longer than the maximum lease time, it is automatically shortened to the specified time. The default lease time defaults to 1h, the maximum lease time to 12h. Shorter lease times are beneficial if the configuration data in DHCP leases changes frequently and clients shall learn the new settings with shorter latencies. Longer lease times reduce the generated DHCP network traffic.Added in version 226.UplinkInterface=¶Specifies the name or the index of the uplink interface, or one of the special values \":none\" and \":auto\". When emitting DNS, NTP, or SIP servers is enabled but no servers are specified, the servers configured in the uplink interface will be emitted. When \":auto\", the link which has a default gateway with the highest priority will be automatically selected. When \":none\", no uplink interface will be selected. Defaults to \":auto\".Added in version 249.EmitDNS=, DNS=¶EmitDNS= takes a boolean. Configures whether the DHCP leases handed out to clients shall contain DNS server information. Defaults to \"yes\". The DNS servers to pass to clients may be configured with the DNS= option, which takes a list of IPv4 addresses, or special value \"_server_address\" which will be converted to the address used by the DHCP server.If the EmitDNS= option is enabled but no servers configured, the servers are automatically propagated from an \"uplink\" interface that has appropriate servers set. The \"uplink\" interface is determined by the default route of the system with the highest priority. Note that this information is acquired at the time the lease is handed out, and does not take uplink interfaces into account that acquire DNS server information at a later point. If no suitable uplink interface is found the DNS server data from /etc/resolv.conf is used. Also, note that the leases are not refreshed if the uplink network configuration changes. To ensure clients regularly acquire the most current uplink DNS server information, it is thus advisable to shorten the DHCP lease time via MaxLeaseTimeSec= described above.This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is specified, then all DNS servers specified earlier are cleared.Added in version 226.EmitNTP=, NTP=, EmitSIP=, SIP=, EmitPOP3=, POP3=, EmitSMTP=, SMTP=, EmitLPR=, LPR=¶Similar to the EmitDNS= and DNS= settings described above, these settings configure whether and what server information for the indicate protocol shall be emitted as part of the DHCP lease. The same syntax, propagation semantics and defaults apply as for EmitDNS= and DNS=.Added in version 226.EmitRouter=, Router=¶The EmitRouter= setting takes a boolean value, and configures whether the DHCP lease should contain the router option. The Router= setting takes an IPv4 address, and configures the router address to be emitted. When the Router= setting is not specified, then the server address will be used for the router option. When the EmitRouter= setting is disabled, the Router= setting will be ignored. The EmitRouter= setting defaults to true, and the Router= setting defaults to unset. Added in version 230.EmitTimezone=, Timezone=¶Takes a boolean. Configures whether the DHCP leases handed out to clients shall contain timezone information. Defaults to \"yes\". The Timezone= setting takes a timezone string (such as \"Europe/Berlin\" or \"UTC\") to pass to clients. If no explicit timezone is set, the system timezone of the local host is propagated, as determined by the /etc/localtime symlink.Added in version 226.BootServerAddress=¶Takes an IPv4 address of the boot server used by e.g. PXE boot systems. When specified, this address is sent in the siaddr field of the DHCP message header. See RFC 2131 for more details. Defaults to unset.Added in version 251.BootServerName=¶Takes a name of the boot server used by e.g. PXE boot systems. When specified, this name is sent in the DHCP option 66 (\"TFTP server name\"). See RFC 2132 for more details. Defaults to unset.Note that typically setting one of BootServerName= or BootServerAddress= is sufficient, but both can be set too, if desired.Added in version 251.BootFilename=¶Takes a path or URL to a file loaded by e.g. a PXE boot loader. When specified, this path is sent in the DHCP option 67 (\"Bootfile name\"). See RFC 2132 for more details. Defaults to unset.Added in version 251.IPv6OnlyPreferredSec=¶Takes a timespan. Controls the RFC 8925 IPv6-Only Preferred option. Specifies the DHCPv4 option to indicate that a host supports an IPv6-only mode and is willing to forgo obtaining an IPv4 address if the network provides IPv6 connectivity. Defaults to unset, and not send the option. The minimum allowed value is 300 seconds.Added in version 255.SendOption=¶Send a raw option with value via DHCPv4 server. Takes a DHCP option number, data type and data (\"option:type:value\"). The option number is an integer in the range 1…254. The type takes one of \"uint8\", \"uint16\", \"uint32\", \"ipv4address\", \"ipv6address\", or \"string\". Special characters in the data string may be escaped using C-style escapes. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is specified, then all options specified earlier are cleared. Defaults to unset.Added in version 244.SendVendorOption=¶Send a vendor option with value via DHCPv4 server. Takes a DHCP option number, data type and data (\"option:type:value\"). The option number is an integer in the range 1…254. The type takes one of \"uint8\", \"uint16\", \"uint32\", \"ipv4address\", or \"string\". Special characters in the data string may be escaped using C-style escapes. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is specified, then all options specified earlier are cleared. Defaults to unset.Added in version 246.BindToInterface=¶Takes a boolean value. When \"yes\", DHCP server socket will be bound to its network interface and all socket communication will be restricted to this interface. Defaults to \"yes\", except if RelayTarget= is used (see below), in which case it defaults to \"no\".Added in version 249.RelayTarget=¶Takes an IPv4 address, which must be in the format described in inet_pton(3). Turns this DHCP server into a DHCP relay agent. See RFC 1542. The address is the address of DHCP server or another relay agent to forward DHCP messages to and from.Added in version 249.RelayAgentCircuitId=¶Specifies value for Agent Circuit ID suboption of Relay Agent Information option. Takes a string, which must be in the format \"string:value\", where \"value\" should be replaced with the value of the suboption. Defaults to unset (means no Agent Circuit ID suboption is generated). Ignored if RelayTarget= is not specified.Added in version 249.RelayAgentRemoteId=¶Specifies value for Agent Remote ID suboption of Relay Agent Information option. Takes a string, which must be in the format \"string:value\", where \"value\" should be replaced with the value of the suboption. Defaults to unset (means no Agent Remote ID suboption is generated). Ignored if RelayTarget= is not specified.Added in version 249.RapidCommit=¶Takes a boolean. When true, the server supports RFC 4039. When a client sends a DHCPDISCOVER message with the Rapid Commit option to the server, then the server will reply with a DHCPACK message to the client, instead of DHCPOFFER. Defaults to true.Added in version 255.PersistLeases=¶Takes a boolean. When true, the DHCP server will load and save leases in the persistent storage. When false, the DHCP server will neither load nor save leases in the persistent storage. Hence, bound leases will be lost when the interface is reconfigured e.g. by networkctl reconfigure, or systemd-networkd.service(8) is restarted. That may cause address conflict on the network. So, please take an extra care when disable this setting. When unspecified, the value specified in the same setting in networkd.conf(5), which defaults to \"yes\", will be used.Added in version 256.",

When unset, the kernel's default will be used.Added in version 246.TripleSampling=¶Takes a boolean. When \"yes\", three samples (instead of one) are used to determine the value of a received bit by majority rule. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.Added in version 242.BusErrorReporting=¶Takes a boolean. When \"yes\", reporting of CAN bus errors is activated (those include single bit, frame format, and bit stuffing errors, unable to send dominant bit, unable to send recessive bit, bus overload, active error announcement, error occurred on transmission). When unset, the kernel's default will be used. Note: in case of a CAN bus with a single CAN device, sending a CAN frame may result in a huge number of CAN bus errors.Added in version 248.ListenOnly=¶Takes a boolean. When \"yes\", listen-only mode is enabled. When the interface is in listen-only mode, the interface neither transmit CAN frames nor send ACK bit. Listen-only mode is important to debug CAN networks without interfering with the communication or acknowledge the CAN frame. When unset, the kernel's default will be used. Added in version 246.Loopback=¶Takes a boolean. When \"yes\", loopback mode is enabled. When the loopback mode is enabled, the interface treats messages transmitted by itself as received messages. The loopback mode is important to debug CAN networks. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.Added in version 250.OneShot=¶Takes a boolean. When \"yes\", one-shot mode is enabled. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.Added in version 250.PresumeAck=¶Takes a boolean. When \"yes\", the interface will ignore missing CAN ACKs. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.Added in version 250.ClassicDataLengthCode=¶Takes a boolean. When \"yes\", the interface will handle the 4bit data length code (DLC).

The class identifier is specified as the major and minor numbers in hexadecimal in the range 0x1–0xffff separated with a colon (\"major:minor\"). Defaults to \"root\".Handle=¶Configures the major number of unique identifier of the qdisc, known as the handle. Takes a hexadecimal number in the range 0x1–0xffff. Defaults to unset.Bandwidth=¶Specifies the shaper bandwidth. When suffixed with K, M, or G, the specified size is parsed as Kilobits, Megabits, or Gigabits, respectively, to the base of 1000. Defaults to unset and kernel's default is used.Added in version 246.AutoRateIngress=¶Takes a boolean value. Enables automatic capacity estimation based on traffic arriving at this qdisc. This is most likely to be useful with cellular links, which tend to change quality randomly. If this setting is enabled, the Bandwidth= setting is used as an initial estimate. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.Added in version 250.OverheadBytes=¶Specifies that bytes to be addeded to the size of each packet. Bytes may be negative. Takes an integer in the range -64…256. Defaults to unset and kernel's default is used. Added in version 246.MPUBytes=¶Rounds each packet (including overhead) up to the specified bytes. Takes an integer in the range 1…256. Defaults to unset and kernel's default is used.Added in version 250.CompensationMode=¶Takes one of \"none\", \"atm\", or \"ptm\". Specifies the compensation mode for overhead calculation. When \"none\", no compensation is taken into account. When \"atm\", enables the compensation for ATM cell framing, which is normally found on ADSL links. When \"ptm\", enables the compensation for PTM encoding, which is normally found on VDSL2 links and uses a 64b/65b encoding scheme. Defaults to unset and the kernel's default is used.Added in version 250.UseRawPacketSize=¶Takes a boolean value. When true, the packet size reported by the Linux kernel will be used, instead of the underlying IP packet size. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.Added in version 250.FlowIsolationMode=¶CAKE places packets from different flows into different queues, then packets from each queue are delivered fairly. This specifies whether the fairness is based on source address, destination address, individual flows, or any combination of those. The available values are: none¶ The flow isolation is disabled, and all traffic passes through a single queue. Added in version 250.src-host¶ Flows are defined only by source address. Equivalent to the \"srchost\" option for tc qdisc command. See also tc-cake(8). Added in version 250.dst-host¶ Flows are defined only by destination address. Equivalent to the \"dsthost\" option for tc qdisc command. See also tc-cake(8). Added in version 250.hosts¶ Flows are defined by source-destination host pairs. Equivalent to the same option for tc qdisc command. See also tc-cake(8). Added in version 250.flows¶ Flows are defined by the entire 5-tuple of source address, destination address, transport protocol, source port and destination port. Equivalent to the same option for tc qdisc command. See also tc-cake(8). Added in version 250.dual-src-host¶ Flows are defined by the 5-tuple (see \"flows\" in the above), and fairness is applied first over source addresses, then over individual flows. Equivalent to the \"dual-srchost\" option for tc qdisc command. See also tc-cake(8). Added in version 250.dual-dst-host¶ Flows are defined by the 5-tuple (see \"flows\" in the above), and fairness is applied first over destination addresses, then over individual flows. Equivalent to the \"dual-dsthost\" option for tc qdisc command. See also tc-cake(8). Added in version 250.triple¶ Flows are defined by the 5-tuple (see \"flows\"), and fairness is applied over source and destination addresses, and also over individual flows. Equivalent to the \"triple-isolate\" option for tc qdisc command. See also tc-cake(8). Added in version 250.Defaults to unset and the kernel's default is used.Added in version 250.NAT=¶Takes a boolean value. When true, CAKE performs a NAT lookup before applying flow-isolation rules, to determine the true addresses and port numbers of the packet, to improve fairness between hosts inside the NAT. This has no practical effect when FlowIsolationMode= is \"none\" or \"flows\", or if NAT is performed on a different host. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.Added in version 250.PriorityQueueingPreset=¶CAKE divides traffic into \"tins\", and each tin has its own independent set of flow-isolation queues, bandwidth threshold, and priority. This specifies the preset of tin profiles. The available values are:besteffort¶ Disables priority queueing by placing all traffic in one tin. Added in version 250.precedence¶ Enables priority queueing based on the legacy interpretation of TOS \"Precedence\" field. Use of this preset on the modern Internet is firmly discouraged. Added in version 250.diffserv8¶ Enables priority queueing based on the Differentiated Service (\"DiffServ\") field with eight tins: Background Traffic, High Throughput, Best Effort, Video Streaming, Low Latency Transactions, Interactive Shell, Minimum Latency, and Network Control. Added in version 250.diffserv4¶ Enables priority queueing based on the Differentiated Service (\"DiffServ\") field with four tins: Background Traffic, Best Effort, Streaming Media, and Latency Sensitive. Added in version 250.diffserv3¶ Enables priority queueing based on the Differentiated Service (\"DiffServ\") field with three tins: Background Traffic, Best Effort, and Latency Sensitive. Added in version 250.Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.Added in version 250.FirewallMark=¶Takes an integer in the range 1…4294967295. When specified, firewall-mark-based overriding of CAKE's tin selection is enabled. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.Added in version 250.Wash=¶Takes a boolean value. When true, CAKE clears the DSCP fields, except for ECN bits, of any packet passing through CAKE. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.Added in version 250.SplitGSO=¶Takes a boolean value. When true, CAKE will split General Segmentation Offload (GSO) super-packets into their on-the-wire components and dequeue them individually. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.Added in version 250.RTTSec=¶Specifies the RTT for the filter. Takes a timespan. Typical values are e.g. 100us for extremely high-performance 10GigE+ networks like datacentre, 1ms for non-WiFi LAN connections, 100ms for typical internet connections. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default will be used. Added in version 253.AckFilter=¶Takes a boolean value, or special value \"aggressive\". If enabled, ACKs in each flow are queued and redundant ACKs to the upstream are dropped. If yes, the filter will always keep at least two redundant ACKs in the queue, while in \"aggressive\" mode, it will filter down to a single ACK. This may improve download throughput on links with very asymmetrical rate limits. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default will be used.Added in version 253.",

When true, then the tunnel is externally controlled, which is also known as collect metadata mode, and most settings below like Local= or Remote= are ignored. This implies Independent=. Defaults to false.Added in version 251.Local=¶A static local address for tunneled packets. It must be an address on another interface of this host, or one of the special values \"any\", \"ipv4_link_local\", \"ipv6_link_local\", \"dhcp4\", \"dhcp6\", and \"slaac\". If one of the special values except for \"any\" is specified, an address which matches the corresponding type on the underlying interface will be used. Defaults to \"any\".Added in version 215.Remote=¶The remote endpoint of the tunnel. Takes an IP address or the special value \"any\".Added in version 215.TOS=¶The Type Of Service byte value for a tunnel interface. For details about the TOS, see the Type of Service in the Internet Protocol Suite document. Added in version 215.TTL=¶A fixed Time To Live N on tunneled packets. N is a number in the range 1…255. 0 is a special value meaning that packets inherit the TTL value. The default value for IPv4 tunnels is 0 (inherit). The default value for IPv6 tunnels is 64.Added in version 215.DiscoverPathMTU=¶Takes a boolean. When true, enables Path MTU Discovery on the tunnel. When IgnoreDontFragment= is enabled, defaults to false. Otherwise, defaults to true.Added in version 215.IgnoreDontFragment=¶Takes a boolean. When true, enables IPv4 Don't Fragment (DF) suppression on the tunnel. Defaults to false. Note that if IgnoreDontFragment= is set to true, DiscoverPathMTU= cannot be set to true. Only applicable to GRE, GRETAP, and ERSPAN tunnels.Added in version 254.IPv6FlowLabel=¶Configures the 20-bit flow label (see RFC 6437) field in the IPv6 header (see RFC 2460), which is used by a node to label packets of a flow. It is only used for IPv6 tunnels. A flow label of zero is used to indicate packets that have not been labeled. It can be configured to a value in the range 0…0xFFFFF, or be set to \"inherit\", in which case the original flowlabel is used.Added in version 223.CopyDSCP=¶Takes a boolean. When true, the Differentiated Service Code Point (DSCP) field will be copied to the inner header from outer header during the decapsulation of an IPv6 tunnel packet. DSCP is a field in an IP packet that enables different levels of service to be assigned to network traffic. Defaults to \"no\". Added in version 223.EncapsulationLimit=¶The Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option specifies how many additional levels of encapsulation are permitted to be prepended to the packet. For example, a Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option containing a limit value of zero means that a packet carrying that option may not enter another tunnel before exiting the current tunnel. (see RFC 2473). The valid range is 0…255 and \"none\". Defaults to 4. Added in version 226.Key=¶The Key= parameter specifies the same key to use in both directions (InputKey= and OutputKey=). The Key= is either a number or an IPv4 address-like dotted quad. It is used as mark-configured SAD/SPD entry as part of the lookup key (both in data and control path) in IP XFRM (framework used to implement IPsec protocol). See ip-xfrm — transform configuration for details. It is only used for VTI/VTI6, GRE, GRETAP, and ERSPAN tunnels.Added in version 231.InputKey=¶The InputKey= parameter specifies the key to use for input. The format is same as Key=. It is only used for VTI/VTI6, GRE, GRETAP, and ERSPAN tunnels.Added in version 231.OutputKey=¶The OutputKey= parameter specifies the key to use for output. The format is same as Key=. It is only used for VTI/VTI6, GRE, GRETAP, and ERSPAN tunnels.Added in version 231.Mode=¶An \"ip6tnl\" tunnel can be in one of three modes \"ip6ip6\" for IPv6 over IPv6, \"ipip6\" for IPv4 over IPv6 or \"any\" for either. Added in version 219.Independent=¶Takes a boolean. When false (the default), the tunnel is always created over some network device, and a .network file that requests this tunnel using Tunnel= is required for the tunnel to be created. When true, the tunnel is created independently of any network as \"tunnel@NONE\".Added in version 235.AssignToLoopback=¶Takes a boolean. If set to \"yes\", the loopback interface \"lo\" is used as the underlying device of the tunnel interface. Defaults to \"no\".Added in version 243.AllowLocalRemote=¶Takes a boolean. When true allows tunnel traffic on ip6tnl devices where the remote endpoint is a local host address. When unset, the kernel's default will be used. Added in version 237.FooOverUDP=¶Takes a boolean. Specifies whether FooOverUDP= tunnel is to be configured. Defaults to false. This takes effects only for IPIP, SIT, GRE, and GRETAP tunnels. For more detail information see Foo over UDPAdded in version 240.FOUDestinationPort=¶This setting specifies the UDP destination port for encapsulation. This field is mandatory when FooOverUDP=yes, and is not set by default.Added in version 240.FOUSourcePort=¶This setting specifies the UDP source port for encapsulation. Defaults to 0 — that is, the source port for packets is left to the network stack to decide.Added in version 240.Encapsulation=¶Accepts the same key as in the [FooOverUDP] section.Added in version 240.IPv6RapidDeploymentPrefix=¶Reconfigure the tunnel for IPv6 Rapid Deployment, also known as 6rd. The value is an ISP-specific IPv6 prefix with a non-zero length. Only applicable to SIT tunnels.Added in version 240.ISATAP=¶Takes a boolean. If set, configures the tunnel as Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) tunnel. Only applicable to SIT tunnels. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.Added in version 240.SerializeTunneledPackets=¶Takes a boolean. If set to yes, then packets are serialized. Only applies for GRE, GRETAP, and ERSPAN tunnels. When unset, the kernel's default will be used. Added in version 240.ERSPANVersion=¶Specifies the ERSPAN version number. Takes 0 for version 0 (a.k.a. type I), 1 for version 1 (a.k.a. type II), or 2 for version 2 (a.k.a. type III). Defaults to 1.Added in version 252.ERSPANIndex=¶Specifies the ERSPAN v1 index field for the interface. Takes an integer in the range 0…1048575, which is associated with the ERSPAN traffic's source port and direction. Only used when ERSPANVersion=1. Defaults to 0.Added in version 240.ERSPANDirection=¶Specifies the ERSPAN v2 mirrored traffic's direction. Takes \"ingress\" or \"egress\". Only used when ERSPANVersion=2. Defaults to \"ingress\".Added in version 252.ERSPANHardwareId=¶Specifies an unique identifier of the ERSPAN v2 engine. Takes an integer in the range 0…63. Only used when ERSPANVersion=2.
